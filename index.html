    OptiCVX is a domain-specific language for convex optimization.
    OptiCVX is developed as a research project from Stanford University's
    <a href="http://ppl.stanford.edu/main/">Pervasive Parallelism Laboratory (PPL)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    OptiCVX is written in Scala.  It allows for modeling convex programs using the same
    philosophy as CVX, diciplined convex programming.  OptiCVX transforms the DSL
    program into a conic optimization program using convex program rewriting rules,
    generates an (optionally) parallel solver, and gives the user the option to either
    immediately run this solver or output the solver as code. This differs from the behavior of CVX
    in that the verification of convexity and the conversion into a conic problem
    are done only once, as staging time (similar to compile time).

    OptiCVX is currently in early development.
